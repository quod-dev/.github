# Quod

> **Reasoned pull‑request reviews.**

Quod is an organisation focused on building tooling that helps teams understand **why** code changes exist — not just *what* changed.

Modern PRs are noisy. Diffs show lines, not intent. Quod exists to restore reasoning, context, and clarity to the review process.

## What we build

Quod develops developer‑first tools around pull‑request review and code discussion, with an emphasis on:

- **Intent over diffs** — surface the reasoning behind changes
- **Contextual review** — comments that understand scope and impact
- **Signal over noise** — fewer opinions, more conclusions
- **Minimal UX** — tools that disappear into the workflow

No dashboards for the sake of dashboards. No metrics theatre. Just better reviews.

## Philosophy

The name **Quod** comes from Latin logic: *“that which…”* — the connective tissue between cause and effect.

A good review answers questions like:

- Why does this change exist?
- What problem does it solve?
- What follows from accepting it?

Quod is built around those questions.

## Principles

We try to keep our work aligned with a few simple rules:

- **Small, composable systems**
- **Readable code > clever code**
- **Defaults matter**
- **APIs are forever**
- **Tooling should earn its place**

If a feature needs a long explanation, it probably doesn’t belong.

## Status

Quod is actively developed.

**Quod** — understand the reason behind the change.
